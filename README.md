# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissosrs game for The Odin Project 


TO DO:
// variable scopes are weird in javascript. compare it to C.
// turn the game into an infinite loop, asking if the player wants to continue each time.
// if player wants to end the game, show the results.
// javascript is kinda neat
