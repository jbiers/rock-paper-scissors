# rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissosrs game for The Odin Project 

WHAT I'VE LEARNED:
- appreciate JavaScript.
- how to use loops and functions.
- planning the structure of the program before actually coding it.
- variable scope in JavaScript: the difference of var, let and const.

TO DO:
// variable scopes are weird in javascript. compare it to C. --OK
// turn the game into an infinite loop, asking if the player wants to continue each time. --OK
// if player wants to end the game, show the results. --OK
